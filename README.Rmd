## What?

I am developing the `microData` package to search, browse, and extract metadata from microdata provided by the World Bank (WB), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Household Survey (IHSN), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and International Labor Organization (ILO) via the NADA REST API. Any researcher who has used microdata from these organizations knows how difficult and time-consuming it is to understand and import these data and variables into R. If you are a user or plan to use micradata, then this is the life-saving R package for you. In addition, the package constitutes simple and handy wrapper functions to ease the data analysis process.

## Abstract

The purpose of `microData` is to simplify the process of extracting complex metadata from data provided by various organizations, thereby improving data preparation efficiency. At the moment, it supports five international organizations, namely the World Bank, FAO, UNHCR, IHSN, and ILO. It has the ability to search, filter, extract, and perform other tasks that you can do on the web, but it cannot download the data file itself. This is because, to my knowledge, there is currently no available documentation for use with the API. I think it is due to data license issue because there are few accessible datasets through the API. Furthermore, this package has the ability to assist in obtaining the names of variables from a specific survey, as well as their labels. It also allows you to select only variables that you are interested in and rename them, while assigning variable descriptions as label attributes. You can set custom names and labels for the dataset. Labels play a crucial role when exporting tables and graphs, as they save you from setting long names in manuscripts manually. It also has simple and powerful functions to dummify variables and create a description table. Therefore, this package is available to alleviate all these difficulties.

 <span style="color:orange">**Warning:** Since this package is still under development, I don't recommend you use it in reproducible code, as any changes can happen in the future.</span>

## Installation

You can install the development version of microData from [GitHub](https://github.com/GutUrago/microData) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GutUrago/microData")
```

## Collection

All organizations supported by this package use the NADA API to publish micro-data, which makes use of similar terminologies. Collection simply means gathering multiple related studies or data sets. To see all available collections, you can use `collections()` function.

Note: I used customized gt table theme that I created in [this blog](https://guturago.github.io/blog/gt-table-theme/).

```{r}
library(microData)

collections(org = "wb") |> 
  head() |> 
  my_gt_theme()

```



## Searching

This package gives all flexibility of searching on the web. For more see the documentation for `search_catalog()`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
search_catalog(
  keyword = "food",
  org = "unhcr",
  from = 2015,
  to = 2024,
  country ="Ethiopia",
  sort_by = "year",
  sort_order = "desc", 
  results = 10)
```


There is also handy function to check latest publications of these datasets.

```{r}
#| eval: false
latest_entries(org = "wb", limit = 15)
```



You can use `data_files` to see the data files included in the study. Let's see one of the popular survey on the WB. We can also use id number of the study, which is 359 instead of the name (See next code chunk).

```{r}
data_files(id = "TZA_1991_KHDS_v01_M", org = "wb") |> 
  head() |>
  my_gt_theme()
```

How about variables included in the data file? Of course you can check them as well.


```{r}
variables(id = 359, file_id = "F3") |> 
  head() |> 
  my_gt_theme()
```


## Setting Attributes

Variables in microdata are often named something that has nothing to do with the variable except question order like this.

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(mdt) |> my_gt_theme()
```


Then you can prepare another data that contains metadata like this. It will be explained in detail in vignettes later.


```{r echo=FALSE}
head(mtdt) |> my_gt_theme()
```


You can use `set_attributes` function to rename and set labels to these variables.


```{r}
my_data <- set_attributes(
  mdt, 
  mtdt,
  old_name = var_id,
  new_name = var_name,
  label = label)

head(my_data) |> my_gt_theme()

```


labels are also assigned.
```{r}
str(my_data)
```



More coming soon!
