\title{Weighted Chi-Square Test}
\usage{
wtd_chisq_test(data, x, y, w = NULL, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or matrix containing the variables.}

\item{x}{A categorical variable (or its name as a string) to be used as rows in the contingency table.}

\item{y}{A categorical variable (or its name as a string) to be used as columns in the contingency table.}

\item{w}{An optional weighting variable (or its name as a string). If not provided, equal weights are assumed.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether to remove missing values. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list with the results of the chi-square test, including:
\describe{
\item{\code{statistic}}{The value of the chi-square statistic.}
\item{\code{parameter}}{The degrees of freedom for the test.}
\item{\code{p.value}}{The p-value of the test.}
\item{\code{n.cases}}{The number of cases used in the test.}
\item{\code{call}}{The matched call.}
}
}
\description{
Performs a weighted chi-square test on two categorical variables, with an optional weighting variable.
}
\details{
This function calculates the chi-square statistic for two categorical variables, taking into account optional weights.
If weights are not provided, all cases are treated as having equal weight.
