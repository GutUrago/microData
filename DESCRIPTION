Description: An API wrapper package that helps to search, browse, and import metadata
    for microdata published by international organizations. At the moment, the 
    package supports microdata available on the repository of the WB, FAO, ILO, and IHSN.
    These organizations use the NADA REST API to publish collected surveys with different
    types of access. In addition, the package includes some miscellaneous but important functions.
