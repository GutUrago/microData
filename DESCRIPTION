Description: An API wrapper package that helps to search, browse, and download metadata
    for microdata published by international organizations. At the moment, the 
    package supports microdata available on the World Bank, United Nations Food
    and Agricultural Organization, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
    International Labor Organization, and International Household Survey Network.
    These organizations use the NADA API to publish collected surveys with different
    types of access.
